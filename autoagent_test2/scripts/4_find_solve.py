    Based on the following vulnerability report, generate a **fully functional and production-ready Bash script** to patch Ubuntu:
    {json.dumps(report, indent=4)}
    
    Requirements:
    - The script must be a **valid, well-structured Bash script (`.sh`)** that is directly executable on Ubuntu **without syntax errors**.
    - Each vulnerability should be handled **individually**, ensuring that:
    -   Execution and verification are completed **before proceeding to the next vulnerability**.
    -   If a patch is already applied, the script should **skip redundant updates** to avoid unnecessary system modifications.
    - Validate whether patches are already applied **before executing**:
    -   Use commands such as `dpkg -l`, `apt-cache policy`, `uname -r`, and `lsb_release -a` to check versions before installing updates.
    -   If the patch is missing, proceed with installation using **explicit package versions**.
    -   If a required package is missing, install it before attempting an update.
    - Use **explicit `apt-get install` or `dpkg` commands** with specific versions:
    -   Prefer `apt-get install --only-upgrade <package>` over `apt-get upgrade` to minimize unintended updates.
    -   Ensure that kernel updates are handled **carefully** to avoid unintended breaking changes.
    -   If a critical package update is required, verify the packageâ€™s digital signature before installation.
    - Ensure necessary services **restart correctly** after patching:
    -   Restart only the relevant services instead of rebooting the system whenever possible.
    -   Use `systemctl restart <service>` and verify service status with `systemctl is-active <service>`.
    -   If a service fails to restart, log the failure and attempt a rollback if necessary.
    - Disable insecure services like `avahi-daemon`, `rpcbind`, `cups`, and other potentially exploitable services **if they are enabled**.
    -   Ensure that disabling these services does not break essential system functionalities.
    - Implement **additional security measures**, including:
    -   Enabling and configuring **firewall rules (UFW or iptables)**.
    -   Applying **kernel hardening techniques** such as ASLR (`kernel.randomize_va_space = 2`), stack protection, and sysctl hardening.
    -   Restricting `su` access using `pam_wheel.so`.
    -   Enabling SSH security configurations (`PermitRootLogin no`, `PasswordAuthentication no`).
    -   Installing and configuring `Fail2Ban` to mitigate brute-force attacks.
    - Provide structured logging:
    -   Log all operations to `/var/log/vulnerability_patch.log`.
    -   Use `tee -a` or `logger` to maintain a structured record of actions.
    -   Each major step must be logged with timestamps and success/failure status.
    -   If an operation fails, log the error message and provide details on the failure.
    - Include **detailed comments** for each major step to improve maintainability and clarity.
    - Perform a **system-wide verification** at the end to:
    -   Confirm that all applied patches are correctly installed.
    -   Validate system integrity by checking package versions and service statuses.
    -   Ensure that disabled services remain deactivated.
    -   Check if additional vulnerabilities have emerged post-update.
    - Generate a **final remediation report**, summarizing:
    -   Detected vulnerabilities and affected system components.
    -   Actions taken, including patches applied and configurations changed.
    -   Any errors encountered during the patching process.
    -   Whether a **system reboot is required**, and provide a clear notification to the administrator.
    -   The report should be saved in **both human-readable (`.log`) and structured JSON (`.json`) formats** for easy integration with security monitoring tools.
    - Ensure the script:
    -   Uses `set -e` to exit immediately if a patch fails.
    -   Logs failures in `/var/log/vulnerability_patch.log` and provides **rollback** if necessary (e.g., re-enabling services if they were mistakenly disabled).
    -   Implements a **safe rollback mechanism** that restores the previous state if a patch disrupts critical system functionalities.
    -   Supports execution via **cron jobs or remote SSH automation** to facilitate scheduled security maintenance.
