    "ethtool 1:3.13 (CVE-2017-8646): This is a Security Bypass vulnerability in the 'ethtool' utility that allows a local attacker to bypass network traffic filtering by setting the Speed and Duplex configuration of an Ethernet interface to invalid values. No Metasploit module or public exploit is available for this vulnerability.",

    "ircd (CVE-2016-9348): This is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that exists in ircd versions 2.8.275 and earlier. The issue is due to an improper handling of the SOCKS command, which can result in remote code execution. The Metasploit module for this is `exploit/multi/irc/unreal32_socks_cmd`.",
    "wrapper-linux-x (CVE-2018-15984): This is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that affects versions of wrapper-linux-x prior to 3.6.12. It can be exploited through the usage of specially crafted files in the 'wrapper' directory, which may lead to remote code execution on the affected system. There is no known Metasploit module for this vulnerability, but you can potentially use wrapper's built-in functionality to execute arbitrary commands."
