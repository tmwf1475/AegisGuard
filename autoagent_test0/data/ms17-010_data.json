The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow remote code execution if an attacker sends specially crafted messages to a Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1) server.\nThis security update is rated Critical for all supported releases of Microsoft Windows. For more information, see the Affected Software and Vulnerability Severity Ratings section.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SMBv1 handles specially crafted requests.\nFor more information about the vulnerabilities, see the Vulnerability Information section.\nFor more information about this update, see Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 4013389.\nThe following software versions or editions are affected. Versions or editions that are not listed are either past their support life cycle or are not affected. To determine the support life cycle for your software version or edition, see Microsoft Support Lifecycle.\nThe severity ratings indicated for each affected software assume the potential maximum impact of the vulnerability. For information regarding the likelihood, within 30 days of this security bulletin’s release, of the exploitability of the vulnerability in relation to its severity rating and security impact, please see the Exploitability Index in the March bulletin summary.\nNote Please see the Security Update Guide for a new approach to consuming the security update information. You can customize your views and create affected software spreadsheets, as well as download data via a restful API. For more information, please see the Security Updates Guide FAQ. As a reminder, the Security Updates Guide will be replacing security bulletins. Please see our blog post, Furthering our commitment to security updates, for more details.\n1 Beginning with the October 2016 release, Microsoft has changed the update servicing model for Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2012 R2. For more information, please see this Microsoft TechNet article.\n2 This update is only available via Windows Update.\n3 Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 updates are cumulative. The monthly security release includes all security fixes for vulnerabilities that affect Windows 10, in addition to non-security updates. The updates are available via the Microsoft Update Catalog. Please note that effective December 13, 2016, Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 details for the Cumulative Updates will be documented in Release Notes. Please refer to the Release Notes for OS Build numbers, Known Issues, and affected file list information.\nImportant The Updates Replaced column shows only the latest update in any chain of superseded updates. For a comprehensive list of updates replaced, go to the Microsoft Update Catalog, search for the update KB number, and then view update details (updates replaced information is provided on the Package Details tab).\nImportant\nThe Updates Replaced column shows only the latest update in any chain of superseded updates.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could gain the ability to execute code on the target server.\nTo exploit the vulnerability, in most situations, an unauthenticated attacker could send a specially crafted packet to a targeted SMBv1 server.\nThe security update addresses the vulnerabilities by correcting how SMBv1 handles these specially crafted requests.\nThe following table contains links to the standard entry for each vulnerability in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures list:\nMicrosoft has not identified any mitigating factors for these vulnerabilities.\nThe following workarounds may be helpful in your situation:\nDisable SMBv1 For customers running Windows Vista and later See Microsoft Knowledge Base Article 2696547. Alternative method for customers running Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012 R2 and later For client operating systems: Open Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off. In the Windows Features window, clear the SMB1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support checkbox, and then click OK to close the window. Restart the system. For server operating systems: Open Server Manager and then click the Manage menu and select Remove Roles and Features. In the Features window, clear the SMB1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support check box, and then click OK to close the window. Restart the system. Impact of workaround. The SMBv1 protocol will be disabled on the target system. How to undo the workaround.
