# AegisGuard – Research Artifacts

This repository contains research artifacts associated with the AegisGuard framework.  
It includes different versions of experimental agents, scripts, and datasets that were used during the development and evaluation described in our manuscript.

## Contents

- **autoagent_test0 – autoagent_test3**  
  Early versions of automated vulnerability detection agents. Each folder represents a different iteration with incremental modifications.

- **autoagent_testdata**  
  Example telemetry and test data collected from experimental environments, including Windows Server and Metasploitable3.  
  Data has been anonymized and simplified for reproducibility.

- **autoagent_testscript**  
  Scripts used in testing and evaluation.  
  Includes simple pipelines, prompt templates, and generated outputs.

- **autoserver_test_agent**  
  Server-side testing components and analysis utilities.

- **metasploitable3**  
  Configuration files and collected telemetry from Metasploitable3 test environments.

## Notes

- The materials here are not production-ready code, but working experimental versions used during the research process.  
- Some outputs are fixed (saved artifacts) for demonstration purposes.  
- The repository demonstrates the development history and the multiple iterations that contributed to the results presented in the paper.
