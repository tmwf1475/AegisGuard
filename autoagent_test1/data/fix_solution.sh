Based on my expertise in Linux vulnerability assessment and remediation, I've crafted a comprehensive report detailing vulnerabilities found on your system. Here's an overview:

**High Severity Vulnerabilities (2)**

1. **Outdated Kernel Version**: The system is running an outdated version of the kernel, which can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access.
	* Remediation:
		+ Update the kernel using the following command: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y linux-image-extra-$(uname -r)`
		+ Reboot the system to apply the changes
		+ Priority Level: High

2. **Unsecure SSH Configuration Options**: The SSH server is configured with insecure options, making it vulnerable to attacks.
	* Remediation:
		+ Configure the SSH server to use secure options such as "StrictHostKeyChecking yes" and "ClientAliveInterval 60"
		+ Priority Level: High

**Medium Severity Vulnerabilities (2)**

1. **Outdated System Packages**: The system is running outdated versions of certain packages, including dejavu outdate version of kernel, which may contain vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions.
	* Remediation:
		+ Update the Linux to the latest version using the package manager or by downloading and installing the updated kernel from the official Linux website
		+ Priority Level: Medium

2. **Insecure Cron Jobs with Insecure Permissions**: Certain cron jobs on the Gnome shell with insecure permissions or commands, which can be exploited by attackers.
	* Remediation:
		+ Update the Gnome Shell to the latest version using the package manager or by downloading and installing the updated shell from the official GNOME website
		+ Priority Level: Medium

**Low Severity Vulnerabilities (2)**

1. **Unnecessary Services Enabled**: Certain unnecessary services are enabled on the system, which can make it vulnerable to attacks.
	* Remediation:
		+ Disable these services using the `service` command
		+ Priority Level: Low

2. **Insecure System Log File**: The system log file is not properly secured, making it accessible to unauthorized users.
	* Remediation:
		+ Configure the system log file to be writable only by the root user or a designated user
		+ Priority Level: Low

**Verification Steps**

To confirm patch application:

1. Verify the kernel version using `uname -r`
2. Review file permissions using `ls -Z`
3. Check the Gnome Shell version using `gnome-shell --version`
4. Confirm SSH server configuration options by running `sshd -T`

**Recommendations**

1. Update the Firefox browser to the latest version
2. Update the Linux to the latest version using the package manager or by downloading and installing the updated kernel from the official Linux website

Please note that this is not an exhaustive report, but rather a summary of the most critical vulnerabilities detected on the system. A more detailed and comprehensive vulnerability assessment would be required to identify all potential vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation.

To ensure compatibility with Ubuntu and prevent unintended modifications, I recommend creating a backup of the system before applying any patches or updates. Additionally, I suggest implementing rollback procedures in case of failure, such as:

1. Creating a snapshot of the system using `sudo apt-get install -y snapper`
2. Creating a backup of critical files using `sudo tar cvfz /path/to/backup.tgz /path/to/critical/files`

Automating the report generation post-execution and saving results in JSON format can be achieved by using tools like `json-logger` or `python-jsonlog`.
